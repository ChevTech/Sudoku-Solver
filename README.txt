Sudoku Solver

This Program represents a Sudoku Solver. 
The user is presented with a GUI sudoku board and asked to enter any sudoku they would like to have solved.
The Program uses a backtracking search with constraints to quickly compute the answer.

A future goal for this project is to implement a Sudoku Generator.
